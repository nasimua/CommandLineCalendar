# Command Line Calendar
## Codecademy Project

In this project, I made a basic calendar that a user can interact with from the command line. The user is able to choose to:

- View the calendar
- Add an event to the calendar
- Update an existing event
- Delete an existing event

The program does the following:

1. Prints a welcome message to the user
2. Prompts the user to view, add, update, or delete an event on the calendar
3. Depending on the userâ€™s input: views, adds, updates, or deletes an event on the calendar
